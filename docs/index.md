This is intended to be a documentation for starting fMRI data processing on HPC at UA. 

## Starter resources

If you have no other previous experience with MRI data (pre-)processing, here are some external resources that can help you start:

- Dr. Saren H. Seeley's documentation on BIDS, fMRIPrep, MRIQC (local processing): https://rpubs.com/sarenseeley/463941
- BIDS starter kit: https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/
- fMRIPrep offical site: https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/
