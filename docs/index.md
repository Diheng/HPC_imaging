This is intended to be a documentation for starting fMRI data processing on HPC at UA. It mainly serves two purposes: 1. document the way I implement data (pre)processing for my doctoral dissertation and in the same time, 2. provide an example of one way to do that. This documentation is not intended to be exhaustive, however, external documentations will be provided at the beginning of each step for a deeper dive if needed.

## Starter resources

If you have no other previous experience with MRI data (pre-)processing, here are some external resources that can help you start:

- Dr. Saren H. Seeley's documentation on BIDS, fMRIPrep, MRIQC (local processing): [Read here](https://rpubs.com/sarenseeley/463941)
- [BIDS starter kit](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/)
- fMRIPrep offical site: [Here](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/)

Join Neuroimaging Workshops group (on D2L) for more imaging data processing workshops and tutorials. Usually meet on Mondays. Email Dianne Patterson ([dkp@arizona.edu](mailto:dkp@arizona.edu)) to be added to the D2L site.

## Converting your DICOM files to BIDS format

fMRIPrep is a *BIDS* app, meaning that it takes BIDS format data folders as input. BIDS stands for Brain Imaging Data Structure. It is recommended as a uniform structure to facilitate consistent collaboration between labs. See [BIDS starter kit](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/) for more information.

For data security purposes, it is recommended you convert your dataset with a secure local lab machine.

For better incoporation of the fieldmap, we will use 

## Starting with HPC@UA

### External resources
- Dr. Dianne Patterson's documentation on neural imaging on HPC@UA: [Neuroimaging-core documentation](https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hpc.html)

### Setting up your account on HPC

Here is the page for requesting an accout for HPC@UA: [HPC Account Creation](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Account+Creation)

If you are a PI, you will be registering a PI account, which will give you authority to sponsor individual or group access to HPC. For most of the graduate students, you will most likely requesting a sponsoered HPC account, which will be created upon approved from your sponsor (most likely your PI).

### Transferring data to HPC

*Note on data security:* HPC storages in general is not HIPAA compliant. It is recommended to convert your raw DICOM files to BIDS format, and then deface all imaging data before you transfer the data to HPC for further pre-processing.

- Globus:
Globus is the preferred way to transfer data from your local machine to HPC. Here is a 7 min video showing how to do that: [HPC 1b: Data Transfer](https://arizona.openclass.ai/resource/lesson-619ed67e898b4fb790c4e52a)

### Storage options:

- HIPAA Box: This is recommanded if you want to do all your preprocessing on HPC. If you have access to a secure local machine for DICOM to BIDS convertion and defacing process (see below for more detail), you can skip this.

Note: Each faculty at UA can request a 50 GB HIPAA Box account for free.
