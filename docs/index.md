# Imaging (fMRI) data processing with High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at the University of Arizona

Author: Diheng Zhang ([Email me](mailto:diheng.zhang@gmail.com)

This is intended to be a documentation for starting fMRI data processing on HPC at UA. 

## Starter resources

If you have no other previous experience with MRI data (pre-)processing, here are some external resources that can help you start:

- Dr. Saren H. Seeley's documentation on BIDS, fMRIPrep, MRIQC (local processing): [Read here](https://rpubs.com/sarenseeley/463941)
- [BIDS starter kit](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/)
- fMRIPrep offical site: [Here](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/)

Join Neuroimaging Workshops group (on D2L) for more imaging data processing workshops and tutorials. Usually meet on Mondays. Email Dianne Patterson ([dkp@arizona.edu](mailto:dkp@arizona.edu)) to be added to the D2L site.
